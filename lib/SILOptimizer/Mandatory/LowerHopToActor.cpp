/// Lower hop_to_executor instructions with actor operands.
///
/// While the language centers actors as the core concept, the runtime
/// is largely expressed in terms of executors, which intentionally are
/// an independent concept.  Every actor has an executor; actors can
/// customize their executor, subject to three restrictions:
///
/// - Any given actor must report the same executor every time its
///   executor is derived.  An actor can be lazy about creating its
///   executor, but it can't have multiple executors, even at different
///   points in its lifetime.
///
/// - Keeping the actor reference alive must keep the executor alive.
///
/// - Derivations of the executor may be freely removed, combined,
///   or sunk by the compiler.  (Whether they should also be hoistable
///   is more contentious.)
///
/// To facilitate full optimization of hops, SILGen emits hops to actors
/// with a hop_to_executor with an actor operand.  (Among other benefits,
/// this means that OptimizeHopToExecutor will eliminate the derivation
/// operation associated with the hop.)  This pass then comes along and
/// inserts the derivations, turning those hops into hops to executors.
/// IRGen expects hops to be to executors before it runs.
