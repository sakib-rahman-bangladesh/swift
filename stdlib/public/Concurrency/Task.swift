// ==== Task -------------------------------------------------------------------

/// An asynchronous task (just "Task" hereafter) is the analogue of a thread for
/// asynchronous functions. All asynchronous functions run as part of some task.
///
/// A task can only be interacted with by code running "in" the task,
/// by invoking the appropriate context sensitive static functions which operate
/// on the "current" task. Because all such functions are `async` they can only
/// be invoked as part of an existing task, and therefore are guaranteed to be
/// effective.
///
/// A task's execution can be seen as a series of periods where the task was
/// running. Each such period ends at a suspension point or -- finally -- the
/// completion of the task.
///
/// These partial periods towards the task's completion are
/// individually schedulable as jobs.  Jobs are generally not interacted
/// with by end-users directly, unless implementing a scheduler.
@available(SwiftStdlib 5.5, *)
public struct Task {
  // Task instances should not be used as they could be stored away,
  // and sine some tasks may be task-local allocated such stored away
  // references could point at already destroyed task memory (!).
  //
  // If necessary to obtain a task instance, please use withUnsafeCurrentTask.
}

// ==== Task Priority ----------------------------------------------------------

@available(SwiftStdlib 5.5, *)
extension Task {

  /// Returns the `current` task's priority.
  ///
  /// If no current `Task` is available, queries the system to determine the
  /// priority at which the current function is running. If the system cannot
  /// provide an appropriate priority, returns `Priority.default`.
  ///

  /// - SeeAlso: `Task.priority`
  public static var currentPriority: Priority {
    withUnsafeCurrentTask { task in

  /// Task priority may inform decisions an `Executor` makes about how and when
  /// to schedule tasks submitted to it.

  /// ### Priority scheduling
  /// An executor MAY utilize priority information to attempt running higher
  /// priority tasks first, and then continuing to serve lower priority tasks.
  ///
  /// The exact semantics of how priority is treated are left up to each
  /// platform and `Executor` implementation.
  ///
  /// ### Priority inheritance
  /// Child tasks automatically inherit their parent task's priority.
  ///
  /// Detached tasks (created by `detach`) DO NOT inherit task priority,
  /// as they are "detached" from their parent tasks after all.
  ///
  /// ### Priority elevation
  /// In some situations the priority of a task must be elevated (or "escalated", "raised"):
  ///
  /// - if a `Task` running on behalf of an actor, and a new higher-priority
  ///   task is enqueued to the actor, its current task must be temporarily
  ///   elevated to the priority of the enqueued task, in order to allow the new
  ///   task to be processed at--effectively-- the priority it was enqueued with.
  ///   - this DOES NOT affect `Task.currentPriority()`.
  /// - if a task is created with a `Task.Handle`, and a higher-priority task
  ///   calls the `await handle.get()` function the priority of this task must be
  ///   permanently increased until the task completes.
  ///   - this DOES affect `Task.currentPriority()`.
  ///
  /// TODO: Define the details of task priority; It is likely to be a concept

  ///       much of a thing on other platforms (i.e. server side Linux systems).
